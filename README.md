# Cognitive Epoch Versioning System (CEVS)


This document outlines the CEVS Versioning Protocol, a structured approach designed explicitly for versioning cognitive architectures. Traditional semantic versioning systems (such as v1.0.0) are insufficient for tracking the emergent, recursive, and qualitatively evolving nature of cognitive systems. The CEVS format bridges this gap, providing clarity, reproducibility, and symbolic depth in version tracking.

## Structure of the CEVS Versioning Protocol

### General Format:

```
SYSTEM_NAME         @ YYYY-MM-DD
=============================================
E[Epoch Number]-[Cognitive Capability].[Build Number]       @ YYYY-MM-DD-[Git Commit Hash]
=============================================
```

### Explanation of Each Component:

#### SYSTEM\_NAME

This represents the name of the cognitive architecture or system being developed, such as "CEVS." It serves as an overarching identity for the cognitive entity.

#### Date of Origin (`@ YYYY-MM-DD`)

This initial timestamp marks the official starting date or "birth" of the cognitive system, symbolically anchoring its developmental history.

#### Epoch (`E[Epoch Number]`)

Epochs signify distinct developmental stages in cognitive capability. Each epoch marks a fundamental shift or evolution in the architecture's core cognitive functionality. For instance:

* **E1 (Perception)**: Initial capability to receive, process, and structure sensory inputs.
* **E2 (Autonomy)**: Emergence of self-driven goals, decision-making capabilities, and task generation.
* **E3 (Reflection)**: System acquires meta-cognition, allowing introspection, self-assessment, and internal reasoning about its own state.

#### Cognitive Capability Label

This clearly identifies the primary cognitive advancement achieved in the given epoch, such as "Perception," "Autonomy," or "Reflection." It provides immediate insight into what the system is fundamentally capable of at this point.

#### Build Number (`.[Build Number]`)

The build number increments with significant internal iterations within a given epoch, capturing refinements, improvements, or substantial shifts in system behavior or cognitive architecture. Each increment clearly indicates progressive iterations and developmental milestones within an epoch.

#### Date and Commit Hash (`@ YYYY-MM-DD-[Git Commit Hash]`)

This component provides exact reproducibility of the cognitive architecture's state at a specific moment in time. The combination of an ISO date format and a Git commit hash ensures precise identification and retrieval of the architecture's exact developmental snapshot.

## Practical Example

```
CORE                  @ 2025-05-08
=============================================
E1-Perception.0       @ 2025-04-12-g1a9d8c  
=============================================
E1-Perception.1       @ 2025-04-14-gb22ee9  
=============================================
E2-Autonomy.0         @ 2025-04-22-gabc34d  
=============================================
E2-Autonomy.1         @ 2025-04-25-gfb12a1  
=============================================
E3-Reflection.0       @ 2025-05-08-g13f9a7  
=============================================
```

In the above example:

* `CORE @ 2025-05-08` represents the birth date of the cognitive system.
* Each subsequent entry marks clear developmental epochs and their incremental builds, providing immediate clarity on the evolution and capabilities at each stage.

## Presentation and Formatting Considerations

Using structured text formatting (as demonstrated above with equal signs and vertical bars) is visually neat and human-readable. However, if automation or scalability becomes essential, a structured table format or markdown tables could replace manual formatting, enhancing maintainability without sacrificing clarity. Here's an example alternative markdown table format:

| Epoch | Capability | Build | Date       | Git Commit |
| ----- | ---------- | ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| E1    | Perception | 0     | 2025-04-12 | g1a9d8c    |
| E1    | Perception | 1     | 2025-04-14 | gb22ee9    |
| E2    | Autonomy   | 0     | 2025-04-22 | gabc34d    |
| E2    | Autonomy   | 1     | 2025-04-25 | gfb12a1    |
| E3    | Reflection | 0     | 2025-05-08 | g13f9a7    |

The markdown approach may be particularly beneficial for documentation automation, script integration, or GitHub compatibility.

## Final Notes

The CEVS Versioning Protocol provides a robust, scientifically-grounded, and practical method for tracking cognitive architecture evolution. By clearly structuring epochs, capabilities, builds, and precise reproducibility markers, it ensures transparency, traceability, and a meaningful historical narrative of cognitive system growth.
